## Pricing Psychology & Justification

### High Anchor Strategy

- Studio entry at $800/mo signals "premium decision partner" (not a $10/mo tool)
- Agency tier at $4,800/mo anchors to professional creative services (not software toy)
- Enterprise tiers signal "decision infrastructure" (comparable to Salesforce, HubSpot)

### Volume Incentives

- Annual commitment gives 15–20% discount vs. monthly
- Volume tiers encourage expansion without per-decision nickel-and-diming
- Add-on pricing designed to be attractive for power users (upsell, not friction)

### Value Justification

| Tier           | Decision Quality ROI | Time Savings    | Risk Reduction         | Brand Alignment            | Enterprise Trust |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Studio**     | 30% fewer revisions  | 4–6 hrs/project | Legal defensibility    | Consistent visual language | ✓                |
| **Agency**     | 45% fewer revisions  | 8–12 hrs/week   | Portfolio governance   | Multi-brand coherence      | ✓✓               |
| **Enterprise** | 60% fewer revisions  | 20–30 hrs/week  | Audit-ready compliance | Global brand integrity     | ✓✓✓              |
