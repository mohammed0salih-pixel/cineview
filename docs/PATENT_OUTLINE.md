## Title

Deterministic Creative Intelligence System for Visual Decision‑Making with Traceable Governance

## Abstract

A system that converts visual inputs into deterministic creative decisions using structured signal extraction, rule‑based inference, and governance layers that enforce traceability, versioning, and accountability across outputs. The system produces decision summaries, risk trade‑offs, and recommended actions while maintaining a verifiable audit trail and versioned deliverables.

## Background Problem

Creative decisions are typically subjective, inconsistent, and difficult to audit. Existing analysis tools provide data but do not produce accountable, deterministic decisions. There is no standardized mechanism to tie creative outputs to traceable logic and versioned governance.

## Summary of Invention

The invention provides a deterministic creative decision engine that fuses visual signals into structured decisions. It enforces traceability, versioning, and governance integrity across outputs, ensuring every decision can be linked to its signal provenance.

## Detailed System Description

- Input layer for media ingestion and signal capture
- Visual signal extraction for technical and cinematic patterns
- Deterministic decision engine that converts signals into creative directives
- Governance layer that assigns versioning, traceability, and accountability
- Output layer producing decision summaries, risks, and structured exports
- Auditability framework linking decisions to outputs without exposing raw logs

## Method Flow (Input → Analysis → Decision → Trace)

Input media → Signal extraction → Deterministic inference → Decision output → Versioned export → Traceability record

30. A system for creative intelligence that combines visual signal extraction, rule-based deterministic inference, and governance-first architecture such that creative outputs are inherently traceable, versionable, and defensible in audit contexts without requiring post-hoc documentation or external governance systems.
