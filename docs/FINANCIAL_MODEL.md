## Unit Economics (Customer-Level)

### Studio Tier

- **Annual Price**: $9,600 (or $1,200/month)
- **Contract Term**: 12 months (annual) or month-to-month
- **Setup Fee**: $2,000 (one-time)
- **Gross Margin**: 82%

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**

- Founder time: ~10 hours (demo, onboarding, training)
- Sales materials: $200 (deck, case studies, templates)
- Networking event / sponsorship: ~$1,000 per 5 customers acquired
- **Total CAC**: $8,000 per customer
- **Note**: Decreases over time as referrals increase (target: $4,000 by Year 2)

**LTV (Lifetime Value) - 3 Year Cohort**

- **Year 1**: $9,600 + $2,000 (setup) = $11,600
- **Year 2**: $9,600 + $1,200 (add-on expansion, avg) = $10,800
- **Year 3**: $9,600 + $1,600 (higher tier upgrade) = $11,200
- **3-Year LTV**: $33,600
- **36-month LTV after CAC**: $25,600
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 4.3:1 (strong, >3:1 is healthy)

**Payback Period**

- Monthly revenue per customer: $800
- Monthly COGS (hosting, support): $200
- **Monthly profit**: $600
- **Payback**: $8,000 CAC ÷ $600 = **13.3 months** (acceptable for enterprise SaaS)
- **Adjusted payback (including setup fee)**: ~12 months

**Churn Analysis**

- Year 1: 0% churn (pilot customers, high NPS)
- Year 2: 3% monthly (target: <5%)
- Year 3: 2% monthly (matured product, better retention)
- **Note**: Expansion revenue offsets base churn (upsell > churn impact)

**Year 1 (Monthly, $150K burn rate)**

| Category               | Monthly   | Annual      | Notes                                                |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Salaries (team of 4–5) | $60K      | $720K       | Founder (no salary Year 1), 2 engineers, 1 ML, 1 ops |

**Fixed vs. Variable**

- **Fixed**: Salaries, office, tools (~$80K/mo)
- **Variable**: Sales, legal, infrastructure (scales with customers)

### Break-Even Analysis

**Year 1**

- MRR at break-even: $105K (OpEx) ÷ 75% (blended margin) = $140K MRR
- **Achieved by month 14** (after $2.5M seed)
- Revenue at month 12: $100K MRR (pre-breakeven, expected)

**Year 2**

- OpEx increases to ~$200K/mo (larger team)
- MRR at break-even: ~$270K
- **Achieved by month 8** (faster due to revenue growth)

**Year 3**

- OpEx increases to ~$300K/mo (sales team, marketing)
- MRR at break-even: ~$400K
- **Already profitable** by month 1 (revenue carries forward)

---

## Cash Flow Assumptions

### Assumptions

1. **Collect revenue upfront** (annual contracts, paid in advance)
2. **30-day payment terms** for payment processors (Stripe holds 2–3 days)
3. **OpEx paid monthly** (salaries on 1st, expenses throughout month)
4. **No inventory** (software, no COGS inventory financing)
5. **Tax liability deferred** (loss-making year 1–2, carried forward)

### Cash Runway

**Starting cash**: $2.5M (Series Seed)

**Year 1 Cash**

- Cumulative revenue: $315K (conservative) + $240K setup = $555K
- Cumulative OpEx: ~$1,270K
- **Cumulative burn**: -$715K
- **Ending cash**: $2.5M – $715K = **$1.785M**

**Year 2 Cash** (starting with $1.785M)

- Projected revenue: $8.54M (aggressive growth)
- Projected OpEx: $2.4M (larger team)
- \*\*Cumulative": +$6.14M
- **Ending cash**: $1.785M + $6.14M = **$7.925M**

**Runway at end of Year 2**: 39 months (very strong)

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Key Variables & Impact on ARR

**Scenario 1: Conservative (No upside)**

- Customer acquisition: 50% slower
- Churn: 2% monthly (vs. <3% target)
- Expansion: 0% (no add-ons)
- **Year 3 ARR**: $3.5M (vs. $28.2M target)
- **Still profitable**: Yes, healthy margins

**Scenario 2: Base Case (Modeled)**

- Customer acquisition: On target (25 → 80 → 200)
- Churn: <3% monthly
- Expansion: 10% annual revenue growth per customer
- **Year 3 ARR**: $28.2M
- **Status**: Well-capitalized for Series B

**Scenario 3: Aggressive (Upside)**

- Customer acquisition: 2x target (50 → 160 → 400)
- Churn: <1% monthly
- Expansion: 20% annual growth per customer
- **Year 3 ARR**: $60M+
- **Status**: Acquisition target for Adobe/Figma at $500M+ valuation

### Sensitivity to Pricing

- **10% price increase**: +$2.8M Year 3 ARR (assume 5% churn)
- **20% price decrease**: –$5.6M Year 3 ARR (assume 10% increase in customer acquisition)
- **Conclusion**: Pricing is conservative; room to increase (or maintain at premium positioning)

### Sensitivity to CAC

- **CAC increases 50%** (from $8K to $12K studio): Payback extends from 13 → 18 months (still healthy)
- **CAC decreases 50%** (from $8K to $4K): Payback drops to 6 months (very healthy, room to invest more in acquisition)
- **Conclusion**: Model is robust to CAC variability

---

## Valuation Framework

### Post-Money Valuation (Series A)

**Method 1: Revenue Multiple**

- Year 2 ARR: $8.54M
- SaaS multiple (creative tech): 6–8x revenue (Figma: 40x at IPO, Stripe: 10x series funding)
- **Conservative (6x)**: $51M
- **Optimistic (8x)**: $68M

**Method 2: Rule of 40**

- Growth rate: 300% YoY (Year 1→2 ARR growth)
- Target multiple: 8–10x (for 300% growth, younger startups)
- **Valuation range**: $50–100M

**Method 3: Comparable Company**

- Figma (2020, Series D): $10B valuation, $300M ARR → 33x multiple
- Frame.io (pre-acquisition): ~$750M, $100M ARR → 7.5x multiple
- **CineView (Series A)**: 6–8x revenue multiple reasonable
- **Valuation**: $50–70M post-Series A

### Series A Financing

- **Target raise**: $8–12M
- **Post-money valuation**: $50–70M
- **Founder dilution**: ~15% (typical Series A)
- **Founder ownership post-Series A**: ~55% (from 68% pre-seed)

5. **OpEx**: Includes healthy buffer for unexpected costs

### Quarterly Forecast Review

- **Every quarter**: Compare actual vs. projected revenue, churn, CAC
- **Variance >10%**: Trigger strategy review
- **Reforecast annually**: Update assumptions based on validated data

### Funding Milestones (Series A Requirements)

- $1M+ ARR (achieved by month 18)
- <5% monthly churn (target: <3%)
- NPS >60 (target: 65+)
- 3+ referenceable customers
