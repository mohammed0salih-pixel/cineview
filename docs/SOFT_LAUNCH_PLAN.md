# CineView AI — Soft Launch Plan (High‑Status)

## Executive Summary

A 60‑day private launch targeting 5–10 invite‑only creative studios. Goal: validate product‑market fit, gather case studies, and establish the brand as a "director‑level decision partner" before broader market expansion.

---

## Target Customer Profile

### Primary: Boutique Creative Studios

- **Size**: 15–150 employees
- **Annual revenue**: $2M–$25M
- **Projects per year**: 20–50
- **Decision pressure**: High (client revisions, approval cycles)
- **Pain points**:
  - Long feedback loops (8–12 iterations per project)
  - Unclear decision rationale (client challenges decisions)
  - Team consensus difficult (different creative perspectives)
  - Risk of brand misalignment (too many subjective calls)

### Secondary: Independent Creative Leads

- **Profile**: Freelance directors, design entrepreneurs
- **Decision pressure**: Extreme (every choice is solo accountability)
- **Pain point**: Need to justify decisions to skeptical clients
- **Advantage**: Faster adoption (single decision-maker, no committee approval)

### Early Champions (Look for)

- **Sophisticated clients**: Tech, automotive, luxury brands (high decision standards)
- **Repeat business model**: Not one-off projects; ongoing retainers
- **Published work**: Portfolio studios with reputations to protect
- **Financial stability**: Can afford premium tools (not price-sensitive)

---

## Access & Onboarding Strategy

### Invitation-Only Model

- **Target list**: 15–20 pre-qualified studios (VCs, angels, industry contacts provide intros)
- **No public signup**: Maintain exclusivity and high perceived value
- **Founder-led introductions**: Personal outreach + demo call (120 min)
- **Qualification call**: Discover their decision pain, confirm fit
- **Onboarding cohort**: 2 cohorts of 3–5 studios (staggered, 2 weeks apart)

### Selection Criteria

- **Must-have**:
  - 15+ person team (need organizational buy-in)
  - Active creative projects (not hibernating)
  - Decision cycle: 5+ days per project (CineView reduces to <1 day)
  - Willing to share outcomes & case study
- **Nice-to-have**:
  - Published work / recognizable portfolio
  - International clients (higher governance demand)
  - Active in design / creative communities
  - Adjacent to our investor / advisor network

### Rejection Criteria

- Price-sensitive (startups on shoestring budgets)
- Single-person freelancers (hard to achieve adoption, no team consensus)
- Commodity service providers (low decision sophistication)
- Non-collaborative (unlikely to give feedback)

---

## Launch Narrative & Positioning

### Core Message: "Not a Tool. A Decision Partner."

**Onboarding framing** (not a feature list):

- Not: "AI-powered creative analysis"
- Not: "Automated design feedback"
- **YES**: "A director-level collaborator that transforms your creative decisions from ambiguous to defensible"

### Value Proposition (3-Point)

1. **Faster decisions**: 4–6 hours instead of 2–3 days (less client back-and-forth)
2. **Clearer rationale**: Every choice backed by signal evidence (easier to defend)
3. **Consistent quality**: Same decision logic applied every time (builds studio reputation)

### Tone & Communication

- Editorial, not instructional
- Executive-level (use director language, not technical jargon)
- Calm & confident (not overhyped, not uncertain)
- Examples from real studios (social proof)

## Feedback Loop Design

### Studio Roundtables (Structured)

- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly (Days 8–9, 22–23, etc.)
- **Format**: 60-minute video call with 2–3 studios + founder
- **Agenda**:
  1. What worked? (15 min)
  2. What was confusing? (15 min)
  3. What would you add? (15 min)
  4. Next project planning (15 min)
- **Attendees**: Studio creative director + 1 team member
- **Output**: Documented feedback → prioritized product roadmap

### Decision Review Sessions (1:1)

- **Timing**: After each studio completes first decision
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Purpose**:
  - Did the decision align with studio intent?
  - How confident was the studio in the recommendation?
  - Would they use this again on next project?
- **Output**: Accuracy benchmark + testimonial quote

### Executive-Level Retrospectives (Quarterly)

- **Attendees**: Studio leadership (CEO/Creative Director) + CineView founder
- **Timing**: Day 60, then quarterly
- **Topics**:
  - Business impact (decisions made, client feedback, cost savings)
  - Product roadmap alignment (is this solving the right problems?)
  - Long-term partnership vision (scale to agency tier, etc.)
- **Output**: Strategic alignment + renewal commitment

---

## Success Metrics (Measurable)

- **Usage**: 20+ decisions generated by Day 30, 50+ by Day 60
- **Decision accuracy**: 94%+ accuracy vs. manual expert consensus (validated survey)
- **Time to decision**: 4–6 hours avg (vs. 48–72 hours manual)

### Customer Metrics

- **NPS**: ≥60 (excellent for B2B enterprise software)
- **Retention**: 100% by Day 60 (no churn in pilot phase)
- **Expansion**: 2+ studios indicate willingness to expand to higher tiers
- **Referral**: 1+ studios refer other studios (organic growth signal)

### Business Metrics

- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: $8,000 per studio (acceptable for $1–2K/month LTV)
- **ARR from pilot**: $40–60K run rate by Day 60
- **Case study readiness**: 2–3 studios ready to be publicly named (with permission)

- **Thought leadership**: 1–2 speaking opportunities at creative industry events

---

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency

### Risk 1: Low Product Adoption (Studios Don't Use Platform)

**Cause**: Unclear value, complex onboarding, poor UX
**Mitigation**:

- Founder-led onboarding (not self-service)
- First project set up BY founder (removed friction)
- Weekly 30-min "office hours" for studio questions
  **Contingency**: Pause expansion cohort, extend pilot to 90 days, redesign UX

### Risk 2: Inaccurate Decisions (Studio Feedback: "Decision Didn't Match Brand")

**Cause**: Decision engine rules not aligned to studio's creative philosophy
**Mitigation**:

- Pre-pilot interviews to capture studio's creative ethos
- Build studio-specific rules before first project
- Decision review session after first 3 outputs
  **Contingency**: Custom rule engine development (2 weeks, $5K per studio)

### Risk 3: Poor NPS / Churn (Studios Don't See Value)

**Cause**: Time savings not realized, clients still demand changes
**Mitigation**:

- Set clear expectations upfront (CineView reduces revision cycles, not client demands)
- Track metrics closely (time spent in decision-making vs. revision)
- Highlight wins in roundtables (momentum + social proof)
  **Contingency**: Full refund guarantee + 30-day exit clause (retain goodwill, manage PR risk)

### Risk 4: Case Study Studios Go Silent (No Testimonials)

**Cause**: Studio busy, not excited, or worried about being first
**Mitigation**:

- Secure commitment upfront (before onboarding): "Would you be willing to be a reference customer?"
- Interview early & often (capture wins while fresh)
- Offer incentive: Free upgrade, co-branded content, speaking platform
  **Contingency**: Pivot to "unnamed case study" with metrics only (less powerful but still credible)

### Risk 5: Founder Becomes Bottleneck (Can't Scale 1:1 Support)

**Cause**: Too many studios, founder overcommitted
**Mitigation**:

- Limit pilot to 5–8 studios (manageable, founder capacity)
- Hire contractor success manager by Day 20
- Document onboarding playbook (replicable for Phase 2)
  **Contingency**: Pause new onboarding, focus on existing studios until process is scalable

## Transition to Phase 2 (Agency Tier)

### Go/No-Go Criteria (Decision Point: Day 60)

**GO if**:

- ✅ 4+ studios onboarded (proof of model)
- ✅ NPS ≥ 60
- ✅ 2+ case studies ready for publication
- ✅ 90%+ retention (no churn)
- ✅ $40K+ MRR run rate

**NO-GO if**:

- ❌ <3 studios, or NPS <50
- ❌ >30% churn rate
- ❌ Critical product bugs discovered
- ❌ Key customer requests require major pivot

### Phase 2 Changes (If GO)

- Expand target from studios → mid-size agencies
- Introduce agency tier ($4,800/mo vs. $800/mo studio tier)
- Develop multi-team workspace features
- Build sales playbook (move from founder-led to sales team)
- Launch public brand positioning (exit stealth mode)

---

## Marketing & Communications Strategy (Minimal, High-Status)

### During Pilot (Days 1–60): Stealth Mode

- No public announcements
- No social media (maintain exclusivity perception)
- No press coverage (confidentiality agreements with studios)
- Private Slack channel for studios + founders (community)

### Soft Launch (Day 60+): Controlled Reveal

- **Studio case studies**: Public launch with 2–3 named studios
- **Industry event**: Speaking slot at Creative Mornings or similar
- **Newsletter**: Opt-in email to design/creative audience (VCs, agencies)
- **Founder interviews**: Trade press interviews (The Drum, AdWeek, Campaign)
- **Community events**: Host "Creative Intelligence Roundtable" (webinar, quarterly)

### Key Message for Phase 2

**"From decision ambiguity to decision authority."**

- Tagline: CineView AI makes creative governance built-in, not bolted-on
- Audience: Agencies tired of revision cycles; brands demanding accountability
